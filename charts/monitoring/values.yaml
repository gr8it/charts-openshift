# User Workload Monitoring Policy Configuration
# This chart uses Kyverno to automatically generate PrometheusRule resources
# for namespaces based on their labels.

# Subchart: prometheusrules
# The Prometheus alert rules are inherited from the prometheusrules subchart.
# The prometheusrules subchart is included as a dependency and its values
# are automatically loaded. To override rules, add a prometheusrules section here.
